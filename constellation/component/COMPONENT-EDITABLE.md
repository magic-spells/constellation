Inline-edit wrapper: click to edit a field or the body, saves through the serve PATCH endpoint with an `if_mtime` stale-write guard ([[FILE-SERVE]]). Edit-buffer semantics (⌘↩ saves, Esc cancels) — it declares its own `@input` handler so Puzzle's two-way form binding is not synthesized over the draft.
